# Mod Config Menu

XCOM 2 Mod Config Menu: a shared settings menu for Xcom 2 mods.

### Features

* **Optional dependency** - Your mod still works when MCM isn't installed.
* **Very simple API** - A basic settings page only takes a few lines. You don't have to write UI code if you don't want to.
* **Compiles with your code** - One function call makes the page, another makes the button, and if you're doing it wrong ModBuddy will tell you.
* **Lots of useful features** - You can preview settings, dynamically change one setting based on another, even inject a custom settings UI.
* **Built-in version control**: if your mod and the MCM versions are incompatible, MCM will handle it gracefully.

### Gamers: How do I use this?

1. Install this mod via Steam Workshop or Nexus. (Links coming soon)
2. That's it! If you have any mods that use MCM, it'll just work.

### Developers: How do I use this?

1. Install the MCM mod. Recommend you do this by cloning the repo and compiling in ModBuddy.
2. Add the API source files into your ModBuddy project, and make a few specific configuration changes.
